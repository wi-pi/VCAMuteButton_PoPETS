# About the File

This file is a generalized script to generate figures that pertain to the captured audio derived data.
We use data from the datasets folders to generate an example figure.
The other figures require access to our entire dataset.
This data it too large to include with this repository. If you would like access to all of the data, and therefore, able to generate the rest of the figures locally, email `jwwest@wisc.edu` or `yang552@wisc.edu`.
Running the file on its own will generate the figures, `python3 graphing_script.py`.
